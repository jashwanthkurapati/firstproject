# # end to end machine learning project
#use case of this project
This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by
other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.
2) Data Collection
Dataset Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977
The data consists of 8 column and 1000 rows
this project requres pip/python install in your system then install this dependancies
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
catboost
xgboost
flask
You can execute this project by cloning repository and another way such that creating source src folder
  for better practices you can also create  setup,logger exceptions and utils files.
step by step procedure for implementation :
 frist start with data_ingestion.py file here we are collecting differnt datasets and files and later Data transfomation file here we need to perfome data analysis for machine learning perposes
then creating model.py file for testing all regresion algorithms making dictionary and executing all parralel manner and selecting best score wether it can be accuracy, roc curve (if dataset is imbalenced).
storing models using pkl 
integrating with flask backend creating web interface using html and css javascript filling form getting results.
